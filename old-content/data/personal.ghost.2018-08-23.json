Like \n{{author.name}}, for example, outputs the name of the current author.\n\nThe best way to learn how to write your own Ghost theme is to have a look at \nthe\nsource code for Casper [https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper], which is heavily\ncommented and should give you a sense of how everything fits together.\n\n * default.hbs  is the main template file, all contexts will load inside this\n   file unless specifically told to use a different template.\n * post.hbs  is the file used in the context of viewing a post.\n * index.hbs  is the file used in the context of viewing the home page.\n * and so on\n\nWe've got full and extensive theme documentation\n[http://themes.ghost.org/docs/about]  which outlines every template file,\ncontext and helper that you can use.\n\nIf you want to chat with other people making Ghost themes to get any advice or\nhelp, there's also a themes  section on our public Ghost forum\n[https://forum.ghost.org/c/themes].","feature_image":"https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/design.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","created_at":"2018-08-23T11:56:19.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2018-08-23T11:56:19.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2018-08-23T11:56:19.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null},{"id":"5b7ea0e4658dd808299d5e1f","uuid":"cfca8259-a47e-4ea5-850c-1e2432fd6cdc","title":"Advanced Markdown tips","slug":"advanced-markdown","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"There are lots of powerful things you can do with the Ghost editor\\n\\nIf you've gotten pretty comfortable with [all the basics](/the-editor/) of writing in Ghost, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of things you can do with Markdown!\\n\\nAs with the last post about the editor, you'll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we're using.\\n\\n\\n## Special formatting\\n\\nAs well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:\\n\\n+ ~~strike through~~\\n+ ==highlight==\\n+ \\\\*escaped characters\\\\*\\n\\n\\n## Writing code blocks\\n\\nThere are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block.

You can think of Ghost tags a lot like Gmail labels. By tagging\nposts with one or more keyword, you can organise articles into buckets of\nrelated content.\n\nBasic tagging\nWhen you write a post, you can assign tags to help differentiate between\ncategories of content. For example, you might tag some posts with News  and\nother posts with Cycling, which would create two distinct categories of content\nlisted on /tag/news/  and /tag/cycling/, respectively.\n\nIf you tag a post with both News  and  Cycling  - then it appears in both\nsections.\n\nTag archives are like dedicated home-pages for each category of content that you\nhave. They have their own pages, their own RSS feeds, and can support their own\ncover images and meta data.\n\nThe primary tag\nInside the Ghost editor, you can drag and drop tags into a specific order. The\nfirst tag in the list is always given the most importance, and some themes will\nonly display the primary tag (the first tag in the list) by default. So you can\nadd the most important tag which you want to show up in your theme, but also add\na bunch of related tags which are less important.\n\nNews, Cycling, Bart Stevens, Extreme Sports\n\nIn this example, News  is the primary tag which will be displayed by the theme,\nbut the post will also still receive all the other tags, and show up in their\nrespective archives.\n\nPrivate tags\nSometimes you may want to assign a post a specific tag, but you don't\nnecessarily want that tag appearing in the theme or creating an archive page. In\nGhost, hashtags are private and can be used for special styling.\n\nFor example, if you sometimes publish posts with video content - you might want\nyour theme to adapt and get rid of the sidebar for these posts, to give more\nspace for an embedded video to fill the screen. In this case, you could use\nprivate tags to tell your theme what to do.\n\nNews, Cycling, #video\n\nHere, the theme would assign the post publicly displayed tags of News, and \nCycling  - but it would also keep a private record of the post being tagged with\n #video.\n\nIn your theme, you could then look for private tags conditionally and give them\nspecial formatting:\n\n{{#post}}\n    {{#has tag=\"#video\"}}\n        ...markup for a nice big video post layout...\n    {{else}}\n        ...regular markup for a post...\n    {{/has}}\n{{/post}}\n\n\nYou can find documentation for theme development techniques like this and many\nmore over on Ghost's extensive theme documentation [https://themes.ghost.org/].","feature_image":"https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/tags.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","created_at":"2018-08-23T11:56:21.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2018-08-23T11:56:21.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2018-08-23T11:56:23.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null},{"id":"5b7ea0e5658dd808299d5e27","uuid":"fc25aaa4-2f93-4a6f-9ce0-9b3783cb39e9","title":"Using the Ghost editor","slug":"the-editor","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"Ghost uses a language called **Markdown** to format text.\\n\\nWhen you go to edit a post and see special characters and colours intertwined between the words, those are Markdown shortcuts which tell Ghost what to do with the words in your document.

Welcome to the new Ghost editor - affectionately known as Koenig.\n\nKoenig is a brand new writing experience within Ghost, and follows more of a\nrich writing experience which you've come to expect from the best publishing\nplatforms. Don't worry though! You can still use Markdown too, if that's what\nyou prefer.\n\nBecause there are some changes to how Ghost outputs content using its new\neditor, we dropped this draft post into your latest update to tell you a bit\nabout it – and simultaneously give you a chance to preview how well your theme\nhandles these changes. So after reading this post you should both understand how\neverything works, and also be able to see if there are any changes you need to\nmake to your theme in order to upgrade to Ghost 2.0.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat's new\nThe new editor is designed to allow you have a more rich editing experience, so\nit's no longer limited to just text and formatting options – but it can also\nhandle rich media objects, called cards. You can insert a card either by\nclicking on the +  button on a new line, or typing /  on a new line to search\nfor a particular card. \n\nHere's one now:\n\nFun announcement coming this afternoon 🙈 what could it be?\n\n— Ghost (@TryGhost) August 4, 2016\n[https://twitter.com/TryGhost/status/761119175192420352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]\nCards are rich objects which contain content which is more than just text. To\nstart with there are cards for things like images, markdown, html and embeds —\nbut over time we'll introduce more cards and integrations, as well as allowing\nyou to create your own!\n\nSome examples of possible future cards\n * A chart card to display dynamic data visualisations\n * A recipe card to show a pre-formatted list of ingredients and instructions\n * A Mailchimp card to capture new subscribers with a web form\n * A recommended reading card to display a dynamic suggested story based on the\n   current user's reading history\n\nFor now, though, we're just getting started with the basics.\n\nNew ways to work with images\nPerhaps the most notable change to how you're used to interacting with Ghost is\nin the images. In Koenig, they're both more powerful and easier to work with in\nthe editor itself - and in the theme, they're output slightly differently with\ndifferent size options.\n\nFor instance, here's your plain ol' regular image:\n\nA regular size imageBut perhaps you've got a striking panorama that you really\nwant to stand out as your readers scroll down the page. In that case, you could\nuse the new full-bleed image size which stretches right out to the edges of the\nscreen:\n\nIt's wideOr maybe you're looking for something in between, which will give you\njust a little more size to break up the vertical rhythm of the post without\ndominating the entire screen. If that's the case, you might like the breakout\nsize:\n\nIt's wider, but not widestEach of these sizes can be selected from within the\neditor, and each will output a number of HTML classes for the theme to do\nstyling with. \n\nChances are your theme will need a few small updates to take advantage of the\nnew editor functionality. Some people might also find they need to tweak their\ntheme layout, as the editor canvas previously output a wrapper div around its\ncontent – but no longer does. If you rely on that div for styling, you can\nalways add it back again in your theme.\n\nOh, we have some nice new image captions, too :)\n\nWhat else?\nWell, you can still write Markdown, as mentioned. In fact you'll find the entire\nprevious Ghost editor inside  this editor. If you want to use it then just go\nahead and add a Markdown card and start writing like nothing changed at all:\n\nMarkdown content works just the way it always did, simply  and beautifully.\n\nof course you can embed code blocks\n\n.new-editor {\n\tdisplay: bock;\n}\n\nor embed things from external services like YouTube...\n\nand yeah you can do full HTML if you need to, as well!\n\nhello worldSo everything works, hopefully, just about how you would expect.
