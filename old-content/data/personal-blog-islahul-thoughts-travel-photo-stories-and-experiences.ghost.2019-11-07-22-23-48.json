It helped me move closer to my girlfriend\nand obviously came with a big pay jump, no taxes. When you move away from your\ncomfort zone into a new culture and city, you try to fight it or let it become a\npart of yourself. But before we get into discussing my musings with materialism,\nI must discuss how I was before. In Mumbai, I had a room in a 2 BHK, with only a\nmattress, because why would someone need a bed? I had two cheap perfectly\nfunctional DIY wardrobes, full of clothes bought online. I still ended up with\npractically 0 savings every year. Where did all that money go? Mostly on food\nand some on travelling. I would go to all restaurants that had different\ncuisines and try them out. My appreciation of other cuisines began when I\nstarted cooking myself. Under my girlfriend's guidance, I learned to cook\ncontinental dishes at ease. It has been over 2 years since I cook dinner for\nmyself. But the point of bringing this up was I was very clear in my mind that\nexperiences are worth more than possessions. I was also pretty clear that I\ncould not save towards a better life.\n\nWith the perspective that moving to a new culture brings about a great deal of\nself-discovery and adventure, I made up my mind to move out of India. After a\nfew months, an opportunity from Dubai showed up and I took it. The first day I\narrived here, I got a look at Burj Khalifa. Trust me no matter how many times\nyou look at it in pictures or movies, it will amaze you. It still amazes me. The\nreal cultural shock though is how great everyone looked. When you walk into\nDIFC, a financial centre close to where I work, take a look around and you will\nsee well-dressed people. Their version of casual means switching pants with\nshorts, but keeping the jacket on. A part of the reason is the clothes but a\npart of it is their fitness as well. Some say Dubai companies have a hidden\n'fitness' qualification which essentially means having looks as a hiring factor.\nI can't say it's true but that would be an easy explanation.\n\nOur office runs from Mon-Fri, instead of the standard Sun-Thu around here. This\nmeans you have one weekend and one working day for everyone but you. Makes life\na lot easy when you have to go to the bank or want emptier malls and beaches.\nEnough of the drifting, let's get back to the main subject - materialism. Over\nthe years, a core part of my identity became geeking out on Superhero stuff, TV\nseries, Movies, Comics and hence the collection of Superhero T-shirts. I was\ntold we were supposed to wear formals at work. I still brought all of those\nT-shirts and some of the shirts from Mumbai. Rest donated. A month after all of\nthose shirts would end up in a bag ready for donation and T-shirts used for\nsleeping. I had not got my full and final settlement money from the previous\ncompany so I barely made it through to the first salary. It involved a couple of\nworse shirts and pants than I started with. I clearly did not get back to the\nsubject.\n\nIn Mumbai, we would feel superior over the guys in suits because we were the\ncool kids. The startup techies ready to become millionaires in equity. Plus\nprogramming as a career is pretty meritocratic, no one really cares about your\npresentation. Presenting ideas is important, but when you take looks out of the\nequation it becomes a straightforward communication. Here I soon realised I am\nstill the outlier but in a 'not cool' way.\n\nWhen you move to a new city, you think you are bringing memories and reputation\nalong, but sooner than you realise you can hold on to neither.I made up my mind\nto try the dark side and try to appreciate looks the way people around clearly\ndo. Here the materialism began. The pursuit was to reach the Dubai standard of\nappearance and to remove the awkwardness of poor dressing choices, something I\nnever had to care about before. I started geeking out on this. I started here \nGSElevator's popular post\n[http://www.businessinsider.de/the-goldman-sachs-elevator-guide-to-dressing-like-a-gentleman-2016-2?r=US&IR=T]\n. I wasn't entirely convinced but it's a great starting point. And then I went\non to read countless of intriguing advice, blogs, and Reddit threads. The best\nsources of advice IMHO are youtube videos and subreddits. I have tried to put\nsome of them in an edible format below.\n\nIt's all about the fit\nThis is probably the best and the most important advice out there. When I\neventually ended up with a good fit, it was a 38 trimmed/tailored fit as opposed\nto 40 regular. The latter now looks horrible on me. The definition of a good fit\nis when your clothes are not stretching but at the same time not hanging on you.\nIt's a great feeling once you find it. Shirt fits\n[http://suitesuit.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SHIRT_FIT.png]. I decided it\nwas time for me to graduate away from laces to a loafer. I bought a relatively\ncheap loafer which expanded as hell within a week and despite my attempts to\nsalvage it, it was used as a slipper before I got tired of it and threw it in\nthe garbage. Leather expands.  \nRegarding jeans/trousers, I love the slightly stretchable material and a good\nfit. I converted from regular washed jeans to slim dark raw denim. No change in\nwaist size. A great thing that takes trousers from decent to perfect is to hem\nthem. Length does matter(despite what you've been told). Get the adjustment done\nright when you buy it. It will take a couple of days and you will have to\ncollect them but it's worth it.\n\n3x the price will last you 10x longer\nI know you heard this one and believed it, but mostly in the way that it is\nphrased is total bullshit. Stuff wears out. Leather especially, no matter what\nthey tell you or how much care you take(If you still disagree, here are the best\nsteps you can take to treat leather r/goodyearwelt thread\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/goodyearwelt/comments/1ubpyl/introductory_leather_care_guide/]\n). What is true about the advice partly is that better leather looks great for\nlonger. Also, this only applies to the difference between cheap and expensive\ngoods. No jump in durability between expensive and more expensive goods. This\nrarely applies to shirts and trousers.\n\nThe minimal wardrobe\nBetween Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs, they wear almost the same look every\ntime they appear in public. I came across this\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3CLRL32Mcw]  nice Ted talk that helped me when\nI was bothered I would eventually end up buying a lot of things. The core idea\nis that you buy less stuff but good stuff that reflect your personality. I took\nit one step further and just worked on 5 sets(3 trousers + 1 denim + t-shirts).\nThis helps me keep my mind off the everyday hassle of pairing stuff. What it did\nnot help me with was reflecting my personality, formals suck!\n\nEnough of the advice now, this is what materialism looks like. The way I ended\nup living it, was like a game. I would read about stuff and then try to buy one.\nLots of research would teach me about minute things people were passionate\nabout. I never knew something like a raw denim existed. The pair that I have,\nhad its denim sourced from Japan, flew it to Italy where it was tailored. Cost\nme 300$ but when I wore it, I felt like I had never worn a better pair of jeans.\nThe first wash felt great. I became intrigued by sneakers, so I ended up reading\nabout them. Eventually, I found people were quite passionate about white leather\nsneakers called CPs(short for Common Projects). I bought a pair and love them\nand they are probably the most comfortable apart from running shoes. It's some\nwork to keep them white though.\n\nThe important feeling I would much later realise is I was trying to fill a gap\nin this new life. I was trying to feel like a part of this community of\npassionate people. They are geeks in their own way.I realised this when I\ncompare my Louis Vuitton boat shoes as a purchase versus the CP which is a more\nrecent endeavour. Boat shoes cost me ~800$, more than twice the amount I spent\non CP. The boat shoes are great looking, 0 maintenance and solid as a rock. CP,\non the other hand, has a fan following and has people writing about lacing, how\nyou should clean them, ergonomics, life, etc, etc. Guess which one felt better.\n\nI find myself more confident in my presentation and no longer feel like an\noutlier. Maybe in some ways I still am, but it feels nicer now. Maybe the only\nthing I could geek on would be a suit. I have a jacket(only upper part of the\nsuit, with slightly casual patterns) that works on 'smart casual' occasions.\nYes, I did not know about that term too. But there is no real 'suit' community\nthat I like yet. There are passionate people but you can't point the passion to\nexact stuff, the beauty of a great suit is the individual tailoring.\n\nOverall I feel materialism had a good impact on my life. I feel I look better\nand don't need more stuff. It tried to fill a gap subconsciously but I am now\nmostly bored and my minimal wardrobe is complete. Let's leave it at that. Also,\nlet's keep this article between you and me, I am too embarrassed to put it out\nin public.","feature_image":"/content/images/2018/08/16473317_10154361171782291_604250090047584553_n.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2018-08-23T21:08:33.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2018-08-23T21:10:53.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2016-05-22T12:08:00.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":"","codeinjection_foot":"","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null},{"id":"5b7f23332758a2150a61686c","uuid":"5c9eb7cd-5231-473a-8ae7-d6647352fffa","title":"Budapest,

Any description of its beauty will fall short of the experience. I went\nthere for a week with my girlfriend to celebrate New Year’s. While the weather\nwas tough on us, it also added to the delight.\n\nWhen thou hast brav’d stormy winds and cold rain, only then shall thou truly\nsavour the hot soup.We stayed near Deniz Musesi\n[https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/istanbul+naval+museum/@41.041548,29.0054,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x3c65e52926db932b?sa=X&ei=zujDVIzuMaHZmAXn_IGoCw&ved=0CIkBEPwSMA8] \n at the coast of Beşiktaş(pronounced Beshiktash) via Airbnb\n[http://localhost:2368/foodie-heaven-istanbul-turkey/www.airbnb.com]. It is a\ngreat location with tram and ferry stations at walking distance. When we\narrived, I expressed my interest in the local food, and to my delight the host\nsaid that you have come to the breakfast capital of Istanbul. There are two main\nparallel streets from the museum into the neighbourhood. One has expensive cafes\nextending into the street that serve ‘Turkish breakfast’, we tried the Sütis\ncafe. The other street Ortabahçe Cad. has a huge variety of places to eat\nextending into a number of smaller streets. I will discuss the food items\nprimarily and then dedicate a section to the lovely Balkan Lokantasi, which\nbecame a perfect place for us to have a full meal without having to empty our\nwallet. \n\n\nEat them you must\nDöner\nDöner also known as Kebab or Shawarma is the most common street food of\nIstanbul. It’s primary ingredient is strips of meat cooked on a vertical\nrotisserie. It is served in many variations. A doner filled pide with a bottle\nof ayran makes a great meal for one person. The dürüm(wrap) version is easier to\neat when walking. \n\n\nPide variation with a bottle of Ayran(cold salty yogurt drink)Döner Porsiyon\nvariationKumpir\nKumpir is a big baked potato, fluffy on the inside mixed with cheese and choices\nfrom a wide range of fillings. I had one with Mexican fillings, hot and yummy.\nThis is the best vegetarian dish I encountered in Istanbul.\n\nKumpir with some mexican chilly and sauce\n\nTavuk göğsü with Turkish Coffee\nTavuk göğsü is a pudding made with chicken and milk. You might think chicken in\na dessert sounds weird but trust me this is amazing stuff! Turkish coffee is\nfresh and strong, but not as strong as the espresso. Do try it at least once. It\nis always served with Lokum and water, just in case.\n\nTavuk gögsü with Turkish Coffee served in an Ottoman style at Sutis Cafe,\nBesiktas\n\nAcibadem Kurabiyesi\nThis was the happiest surprise ever. It was not a part of my list and we just\nrandomly ordered from the menu since it was in turkish. This remains the best\ncookie I ever had. It has a chewy texture and is made with almonds.\n\nThe best cookie ever. Acibadem Kurabiyesi at a Cafe started in 1923Baklava and\nBorek\nI had these amazing sweets from a small shop ‘Kafadaroğlu Börekçisi’ in Besiktas\nthat specialises in these. While it’s hard to explain the difference between\nthem from outside, lets stick to calling Baklava the thicker sweeter one with\npistachios between layers of pastry and Borek a larger family of pastries with\nmeat or vegetables as fillings. \n\nSimit, Chestnuts and Pomegranate Juice\nA stall in Sultanahmet selling chestnuts. Similar stalls around the area sell\nSimit. Simit is a large circular bread covered with sesame seeds. Buy the\nNutella filled ones, they are cheap, tasty and filling. Roasted chestnuts are\namazing to walk with. I had pomegranate juice in Asian side of Istanbul near the\nKadikoy ferry station. Turkey loves pomegranate and hence this also is amazing.\nEven if you had it back home, try it here. \n\n\n\n\nLokma\nYou can find them easily on street stalls. These are fried dough balls(or\ndonuts) covered with sweet syrup. This is very sweet, so the ones with sensitive\nteeth must take care.\n\nPilav\nPilav is a spiced rice with some vegetables or meat mixed. Indians might be\ndisappointed by strength of the spices, but it has a nice subtle taste.\n\nI had this at a place called I❤Pilav in Asian side — Kadikoy. It came in a heart\nshape, but I was hungry. Sorry!\n\nPudingli pasta\nIt’s a misnomer and a relatively simple dessert. Layers of biscuits with\nstretchy chocolate in between. \n\n\nBiscuits and chocolate, what can go wrong\n\nAshure and Sütlaç\nAshure is also known as “Noah’s pudding” It is light, sweet and filled with real\nfruit pieces. Sütaç is a baked rice pudding that is plain and delicious.\n\nAt Balkan! Asure(top) and Sutlac(bottom)\n\nBalkan Lokantasi\nComing from Mumbai, this felt like an unusual concept where you just walked in,\npicked up stuff you wanted to eat, without knowing their price and at the end\npaid whatever cash the guy totalled in his mind. But when you get amazing\nauthentic dishes, in good quantity and at extremely cheap prices, you really\ndon’t care.\n\nThis was the one place we relied on whenever we were confused where we should\neat or were disappointed by a few places or the weather was just too bad to go\nlooking. This was that holy shrine.\n\nBy the end of our trip, we had finished all of their menu except for a couple\nmain-course items maybe. A normal meal with one large bowl of soup, three\nmain-course items and two desserts would cost around 20 TL(TRY / Turkish Lira)\nwhich translates to INR 520 or 8.5 $. It used to leave the two of us full, and\ntrust me I have a large appetite. Meatballs, Kofte, salads, soup, chicken legs,\nlamb, fried liver, eggplant(I absolutely hate eggplants, but I loved their\nversion.), everything here was appetising and tasted delicious.\n\nAs you would expect, this place always has a line of people walking in, and yet\nalways has a place to sit. No frills, people come, grab food, eat it, enjoy it\nand leave.\n\n\n\nContinuing on food items again -\n\nOverrated they are\nDondurma\nThese are the ice-cream of Turkey. Feel free to try them but don’t expect an out\nof the world experience.\n\nLahmacun\nThe pizza of Turkey. This is highly overrated, it is just a super thin crust\npizza with average toppings.\n\nVan’s breakfast / Turkish breakfast\nPopularised for tourists, I didn’t see a point in attempting this expensive\ncollection of the usual items against trying real turkish cuisine.\n\nYou don’t need to spend a lot of money to get the best food in Istanbul, so\ndon’t pick that beautiful cafe near a popular tourist place.

But more\nimportantly work gradually over the next one or two years to get there.\n\nGood luck!","feature_image":"/content/images/2018/10/simple-resume-template.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2018-08-23T21:23:07.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2018-10-06T22:31:21.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2014-10-30T11:23:00.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":"","codeinjection_foot":"","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null},{"id":"5b7f26922758a2150a616876","uuid":"4c3548c4-5166-4747-af56-6a62cf4e3fb0","title":"Lessons on Entrepreneurship from the movie 'Chef'","slug":"lessons-on-entrepreneurship-from-the-movie-chef","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5NTYzNTA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODIwODU1MTE@._V1_SX640_SY720_.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"strong\"],[\"em\"]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"If you haven't watched it yet leave this page and do it.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[0,0],2,\"---------- SPOILER ALERT ----------\"],[0,[],0,\" \"],[1,[],0,0],[0,[],0,\". \"],[1,[],0,1],[0,[],0,\". \"],[1,[],0,2],[0,[],0,\". \"],[1,[],0,3],[0,[],0,\". \"],[1,[],0,4],[0,[],0,\". \"],[1,[],0,5],[0,[],0,\". \"],[1,[],0,6],[0,[],0,\". \"],[1,[],0,7],[0,[],0,\". \"],[1,[],0,8],[0,[],0,\". \"],[1,[],0,9],[0,[],0,\". \"],[1,[],0,10],[0,[],0,\".\"]]],[1,\"h3\",[[0,[],0,\"Have real passion for what you do\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"This is the most powerful message delivered by the chef in the movie.

Money is real and it's flow and intent decides the\nfuture of a country.\n\nAam Admi Party\nSource: http://www.aamaadmiparty.org/donation-list  \nTotal funding(declared publicly): Rs. 28,84,59,420 (read 28 crores, 4.78 million\nUSD) \nRoughly half of the amount raised by the top Kickstart project - Pebble. Half of\nFlipkart's second round of VC funding($10m by Tiger,2010)\n\nRegarding accusations of funding from USA: The party website does show a number\nof Rs. 3,16,11,023 (read 3 crores, 11% of total funding) from contributors\ngeographically in USA. On a closer look you do find a few random(non-indian\nsounding) names in the list with small amounts, but most of them seem to be\nIndian.\n\nRegarding Ford Foundation: This page is pretty self explanatory and an excellent\nrebuttal http://www.aamaadmiparty.org/ford-foundation\n\nExpenses - I am pretty confident they are spending almost all that they have.\n\nBJP\nSource: NA( NOT ANNOUNCED ) \nTotal funding: NA( NOT ANNOUNCED ) \nAccusations: None in particular. Black money accused in general. I do not see\nhow political parties actually generate \"value\" in order to translate into\nmoney. So I will stick to the \"donation theory\".\n\nSince it is an intellectual property that must be protected. I will move on to\nestimates. All assumptions and calculations can be modified by your own. Feel\nfree to play with the numbers, I am just here to throw ideas.\n\nI will begin with estimating the marketing spend. Source for estimating sources:\n Hindustan Times\n[http://www.hindustantimes.com/elections2014/state-of-the-states/advertisement-war-to-win-lok-sabha-elections-may-cost-bjp-whopping-rs-5-000-crore/article1-1207499.aspx] \n \n15,000 hoardings across India for up to 3 months \n2-3 Lakhs to 20 Lakhs per hoarding per month \n15000*200000 = 3,00,00,00,000 ( 300 crore - minimum amount per month) \nx3 = 9,00,00,00,000 ( 900 crore - min amount 3 months ) \nAfter a few rough calculations I did a multiplier of 2 to the minimum which is\ntoo low in itself. But I end up with a number of 1800 crore. \nHoarding expenses - 1800 crore rupees  (298,548,000 USD$ approx half of\nFlipkart's total funding till date)\n\n\"50 top national and regional newspapers across India and plan to release about\nfour to five ads everyday till the end of the election process\" from source \nFor rates: \nhttp://www.quora.com/Product-Marketing/How-much-does-it-cost-to-run-a-full-front-page-ad-campaign-on-a-national-newspaper-like-Times-of-India\n\nNewspaper Ads - 50 X 3000000 X 90 days = 1350 crores(223 million USD, adding to\nprevious, 520 million = Flipkart's total funding till date)\n\nLastly TVCs - from mentioned source \"In TV, the BJP has bought about 2,000 spots\na day across Hindi, English and regional news, general entertainment and sports\nchannels. A spot in most popular entertainment channels cost about Rs. 80,000\nper 30 seconds.\" \n90 days1500 spots average40000 average amount per 30 sec\n\n*TV Ads - 48,60,00,00,000 = 4860 crore(800 million USD) *\n\nTotal marketing spend in top 3 mediums - 8000 crore rupees or 1320 million USD\n\nNow I absolutely no clue about the transportation and rally costs of the\ncampaign. Kindly provide guesstimates in case you made any to my email.\n\nBJP supporters often have a strong PLOT ARMOUR  towards their campaign and\nleaders. They often ask of questions towards the alleged sources of funding for\nAAP, etc.. When they are questioned about their funding by Congress, they\nrespond with questions. We need politicians who respond with answers and not\nwith questions.\n\nWe liked to be fooled, we like hero worship, we love leaders that troll the\nnation single handedly, but its high time we open our eyes to the reality, to\nthe degree of honesty of a player, instead of just shouting out rumours, its\ntime we realise that we can do the calculations ourselves and make decisions\naccordingly. For the genius couldn't keep power, and the greatest orators have\nbeen brutal.\n\nPS - Vote for the most honest of them, because honesty is what you expect in\nlife, with people around you. Why not apply it everywhere?","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2018-08-23T21:34:29.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2018-08-23T21:35:27.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2014-04-14T15:34:00.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":"","codeinjection_foot":"","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null},{"id":"5b7f28bc2758a2150a61687c","uuid":"87fe8310-1ae5-4499-ab79-29c0c522c5bc","title":"Let's change the way we pick our leaders","slug":"lets-change-the-way-we-pick-our-leaders","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"strong\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"http://www.aamaadmiparty.org/\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"I have been observing the way people talk about leaders in politics.

His enthusiasm and drive\nremains with all of us. Lets hope we have many more Jagdish in the mountains\n\nEveryone at one point of their life, face a difficult choice, to leave homeland\nfor better money or stay behind and help make it a better place. Not many people\nhave courage like Jagdish from Avani who take the high road.\n\nAVANI is a voluntary organization working in the Tripuradevi (Pittoragarh\nDistrict), Kumaon region of Uttarakhand. It works in fields of textiles, energy\ntechnologies, health and education. It started working in field of solar energy\nas a branch of Social Work and Research Center(SWRC) , Ajmer, Rajashtan. Rajnish\nJain, co-founder of Avani saw the work there and realised that they can make an\nindependent centre for solar energy services in the hills. They then began the\nwork at Sarla Ashram. They got funding from the Foundation for Rural Recovery\nand Development (FORRAD) for about 60 systems.\n\nJagdish was born in a small village Silinia. He studied up to graduation at\nBerinag but left studies after first year of post-graduation. On asking about\nhis big dreams of going to the plains as a youth, he shares his experience of\ngoing to Haryana to work at a textile export company, the environment did not\nsuit him,his heart was still in the mountains. In deep introspection, he\nrealised that youth go to plains to earn money and then when they become old\nthey come back and become a burden on the mountains. This results in the\npopulation having a huge concentration of non-working men (very young/retired),\nwhich is the largest reason for underdevelopment of this region.\n\nJagdish returned home. Soon he heard about a solar project and went to buy solar\nequipment for himself at Avani’s old centre where he was great influenced by the\nfounders Rajnish Jain and Rashmi Bharti. Jagdish then went for a 1 month Solar\nMaintenance and Social Welfare training at SWRC. He goes on to describe it as\nthe most exhilarating and exhausting experience of his life. He was woken up in\nthe morning at 6am and had to go for physical training. Later they were taught\nhow to assemble PCBs and setup solar panels and batteries and repair. In the\nevening there cultural workshops were held where they would be trained in\ndramatics and puppet shows.\n\nHe wanted to open his own shop as a solar technician but he also liked\ninteracting with people so he got satisfied with work at Avani and with the fact\nthat he was helping more families than he could with his own shop.\n\nHe tells us Avani had made a commitment that by the time they will have\ncompletely used the grant given by FORRAD they would have a sustainable system\non their own. That essentially meant it was not just about giving away free\nsolar lamps. \nBringing solar lighting to villages was not at all an easy ride. People here\nwere accustomed to the lifestyle of staying in darkness since forever; they did\nnot need many electrical appliances. But what he found out with his personal\nexperience that kerosene lamps which were the only existing lighting solution\nwas actually more expensive than solar energy. He needed about 15 Litres of\nkerosene every month at a rate of about 7Rs per Litre. Amounting to 105Rs a\nmonth, 90Rs a month for Solar Home-Lighting made more sense. Convincing\nvillagers the same was an uphill task but he was pretty good at it and had the\nconfidence in himself that he was doing the right thing. It is his clarity of\nthoughts which amazes me. He went to every village and formed an association\n(samity) when at least 10 people were ready. Accounts were made in local banks\nin name of Solar Energy Association of the village. One guy from every village\nwas trained in Solar Product maintenance.\n\nEven after being subsidised the solar home lighting systems cost Rs 7500 which\nwas a huge amount for villagers. So it was decided that they give a down payment\nof Rs 2000 and then pay Rs. 90 per month. This money was deposited in the\naccount of the association formed. If there was a failure of the parts the money\ndeposited in the association’s account would be used for repair. At first it\nseemed pointless to them but after a while they understood the system which was\ndesigned to be sustainable. The importance of the bank account of the\nassociation was that because the battery alone cost about 50% of the price of\nthe product and in case of its failing no-one would provide another battery, so\nthe money villagers were depositing in bank account would be used by them to buy\nnew ones or pay for repairs. People would often question, “What is your\nadvantage in this?” He would usually answer saying, “We are here to bring light\nto the hills and we don’t want someone else from the plains doing it, who would\nprobably sell his products and be unreachable for any further assistance or\nrepairs.” There was a long term vision in mind. In 2003 the project was\ncompleted successfully. By that time Avani’s solar energy department had become\nself-sustaining.\n\nHe loves the fact that this project first of all saved natural resources of\nearth by saving kerosene, secondly the whole system is assembled by local people\ntrained by Avani as its employees. He puts a special emphasis on the training of\nsolar technicians about assembling PCBs.\n\nFour-five years ago, especially after the separation of the state of Uttarakhand\nfrom Uttar Pradesh, interest shifted to this region and power-grid(main\nelectricity lines) have reached most villages. This did result in a decrease in\ndemand of the home-lighting systems but people still need solar systems. With\nthe landscape being fragile there is often a breakdown of electricity which\nsometimes lasts as long as 2-3 weeks. Thus people are ready to buy emergency\nsolar lanterns made by Avani which have both long lasting LEDs and solar panels\nwhich are warranted for 15 years.\n\nHis salary began from Rs 660/month in 1998 earns a meagre Rs.5000/month. He\nsays, “Life was very simple those days, we were young adventurous and ready to\ntravel anywhere to be trained. We had no expenditure.” He is married and his\nfamily lives in Silinia, and his kids Sahil and Jaya are studying 7th  and class\n6th, instead of chasing degrees he wants his kids to have practical training\nbecause it makes more sense to him. \nListening to the echoes of Kumaoni songs, we continue to trek to Basti a village\nnear Dharamgarh, to promote a microfinance scheme for people who cannot afford\nsolar lanterns at once. Through a scheme of a small downpayment of Rs.500 and\nRs.150 per month for 11 months, we can reach a wider income group. On the way we\nmanaged to sell one lantern to a grandfather. It is so delightful to hear him\ntell his grandson, “now no escaping studies at night.” A bright future ahead\nindeed.\n\nYou can visit Avani's website here: http://www.avani-kumaon.org/","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2018-08-23T21:37:42.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2018-08-23T21:38:44.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2013-01-07T12:37:00.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":"","codeinjection_foot":"","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null},{"id":"5b7f29802758a2150a616880","uuid":"1932a69e-acf9-408a-84c9-f0f0ee9e8681","title":"Catching my train home","slug":"catching-my-train-home","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://fbcdn-photos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/269963_10150231508927291_703567290_7450217_4065635_a.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://fbcdn-photos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/263959_10150231503452291_703567290_7450166_3193697_a.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://fbcdn-photos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/261673_10150231514142291_703567290_7450265_6357324_a.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://fbcdn-photos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/259849_10150231514782291_703567290_7450273_3398903_a.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://fbcdn-photos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/270872_10150231515462291_703567290_7450284_6787288_a.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://fbcdn-photos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/270597_10150231510632291_703567290_7450224_5981195_a.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://fbcdn-photos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/269513_10150231510107291_703567290_7450223_7373031_a.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"strong\"],[\"em\"]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Readers please note, I am not at all a crazy guy, crazy things happen to me.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"It was a fine morning at Avani(Tripuradevi(near Berinag), Pittoragarh, Uttarakhand), I woke up at 5am, having a full 5 hour sleep.

Wrapping up final\ndocuments, packed my luggage and bidding adieu to friends at my internship. I\nhad two parathas with tea for breakfast. I stood outside the campus for about\nhalf an hour and no one was willing to take me to Raigar, from where I had to\ntake a bus/shared jeep to my Train Station Kathgodam. Finally Vikram Da who\nworks at Avani decided to drop me in their jeep.\n\nAs soon as we reached Raigar at around 10am, the last bus to Kathgodam was\nleaving. I fortunately got that. It was raining heavily and there were landslide\nscares throughout the way. Robbed of sleep for past few days I finally got some\nfor around 2 hours. At about 12:30pm, I was woken up by hard braking by the\ndriver. When I looked out of the window, I saw soil flowing like water at a\ndistance of about 30m from my bus. The edge of the road was on a steep mountain\nwhich had a violent river flowing about 300m down from the road. I thanked God\nfor I knew how close I was to testing my swimming skills :P . As the slide\nslowed down and settled, a stupid truck driver drove it into the slide and it\ngot stuck halfway. I enquired from the gathered people and they said it would\ntake not more than 2 hours as the crane and bulldozers were coming. I went back\nto sleep in bus.\n\nThe landslide\nWhen I woke up, the land slide had become larger, there was a bulldozer on top\nof it, ‘trying’ to clear the slide, but instead adding 4 times more the soil\nfrom top. It was still raining heavily. My bus drivers and conductors had run\naway with money. I found out that the last bus from the other side of the\nlandslide had returned(towards my destination). My luggage was in the trunk. I\nthen tried to search through the conductors cabinet and found the key, took out\nmy luggage and walked to the landslide. I was dripping wet and the slide was\nstill in a bad condition. I took my suitcase which had become twice as heavy due\nto rain, on top of my head and started walking through the soil. I managed to\ncross it with my jeans completely soiled. I started walking through the same\nroad thinking at least it takes my closer to the next village. I walked down 2km\nwhen I was filled with ecstasy. The last bus had stopped on a restaurant for\nlunch and was just leaving. I shouted on top of my voice and ran down 200m. The\nbus was already full but conductor was kind enough to share his seat. Later I\nfound out that this landslide took 2 days to clear, and that was really the last\nbus to leave that place.\n\nThe Tree\nNot more than half an hour had passed when the driver stopped suddenly and asked\neveryone to stay quiet. A stone of size of a washing machine fell down 50m ahead\nof us. I was awestruck at his hearing capabilities. The bus then continued on\nits way to Almora(the next main stop, half way between my starting point and\nKathgodam). The bus stopped again. This time a tree had fallen across the road.\nIt was not completely uprooted and we did not have a cutting tool. 20 of us went\ndown to move it and found out it was stuck in a u-shaped part of another tree.\nWe could not move it an inch. And as we tried to, stones and soil came falling\nfrom the mountain slope on us, as it was on the side of a small landslide. Since\nit was raining cats and dogs 12 of our group went back to the bus. Eight of us\nhad to catch a train to Delhi so we were still searching for ways. Then a jeep\narrived and two pehelwaans got down from it. I tried lifting the tree from the\nend and managed to lift it a foot high(trust me as heroic as it may sound,\nlifting was infinitely easier than pulling). The pehelwaans and rest of my group\nstarted pulling it. My job was almost done and we tried to hold the tree in a\nbent position for about a minute till the bus driver got courage to pass the bus\nthrough the gap. We washed ourselves in a nearby waterfall, I thankfully washed\nthe pile of mud on my jeans and got back on the ride. I happened to figure out\nthat I would not be able to catch my train, so I sent a message home to cancel\nit.\n\nAlmora\nJust before reaching Almora, we had heard that all routes to Kathgodam had been\nblocked by landslides which would take atleast 2-3 days to clear. A lady in the\nbus, did manage to find out that a car had manage to travel through one route\nvia ramgarh and nainital. But bus driver said he has had too much for the day.\nWe got down at Almora it was 6.30pm and it was getting dark. I quickly had\nsamosas and tea and got back on road. Now I had two options either to find an\naccommodation for next 2-3days which was supposed to be difficult and costly and\ntoo complicated for me, or to go ahead and walk on the route and try my luck for\na ride. I decided to take the road through Ramgarh-Nainital. I kept walking for\nanother 1km when I found a Jeep stand and there was a jeep jam-packed with\npassengers. I enquired from the taxiwalas and they said that this guy is crazy,\nhe is the only person who is taking these people to Haldwani(near Kathgodam)\nfrom such a dangerous route. I said, ‘lets see how crazier it can get.’ I\npleaded that guy to stuff me in, some way. He shared driver’s seat with me,\nwhich essentially meant I was robbed of the right to even yawn.\n\nAlmora-Haldwani\nThe road was very depressing. It was dark, there were huge stones in middle of\nit, small landslides. There were a lot of clouds and fog on our way which meant\nextremely low visibility. Even the driver was shit scared as there was no way\nyou could look at a landslide coming from up at night. He drove for another\nhour, when one van passed us from other direction, which meant the road was\nclear of blocks. After about 2 hours of driving, the jeep bonnet exploded and it\nshut down. I was like, “Man, today is a really screwed up day”. It wasn’t that\nbad I suppose as they fixed it in half an hour. We soon hit the national\nhighway-87(I think). It was nice to see a road with its edge protected and\nglowing.\n\nHaldwani\nWe reached Haldwani at around midnight. I had missed my first train, which meant\nI had to speed up my trip to Delhi in order to catch the next train home. Just\nwhen I reached there, the last bus to Delhi left in front of me and I couldn’t\ncatch it. I enquired that next bus would come at 6:30am. When I started walking\ntowards the railway station, people on the way warned me its not a good place\nfor night and there were no more trains till morning. Still I wanted to enquire\nabout it and probably buy a ticket. When I reached there the station was empty\nand dark. Everything was shutdown. I did go the ATM there and took some train\ninfo from the guard. I went back to the bus depot as it seemed a safer place to\nrest at night as I dint want to spend money on a hotel for another six hours. I\nate a big pack of tiger biscuits and drank slice. I spread my bedsheet, chained\nmyself to my luggage and slept. When I woke up in morning I found a black puppy\nsleeping beside me. I clicked a pic with him and then shooed him off :D. I\nfinally got the first bus in the morning which would give me approximately 2\nhours of head start from Anand Vihar Bus Depo to Nizamuddin station where I had\nto take train home.\n\nNo surprises on this bus trip though, I found a paper which was stained with\ncoffee sugar I had shoplifted(I did buy a desert there :P)\n\nDelhi\nI wanted a bath very desperately. Delhi was kind enough to shower the entire\ncity for me, but yeah travelling in an AC metro wasn’t that pleasant after being\nwet.
